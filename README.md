# Bratacha-SF
A port of my Bratacha mod for NeoForged ported to Satisfactory

- Check the original mod for minecraft [here.](https://www.github.com/eimi-codes/Bratacha-MCNF)
- This mod is best installed with the Satisfactory Mod Launcher. You can find it [here.](https://ficsit.app/)

## About

This mod adds flags to the game. You can place them on walls, on the ground, or on flag-poles. They are available on the Build `Q` menu, in their own tab. Each flag requires 1x Fabric to build. If you want to build a flag-pole, you will need 1x Iron Ingot. The flags are all set to 2:1 aspect ratio, so they should look good on most walls.

## Included

- Most modern countries
- Some multinational flags, like the EU, UN, and NATO
- UK Devolved Nations
- Irish Provinces

## Planned

- US States
- Select historical flags

## Thanks

- Many thanks to [GaeaKat](https://www.github.com/GaeaKat) for helping me with the modding process
